        <p><strong>What Is Alfredo Sauce</strong></p>
       
        <p class='indented'>Now, some may argue that Alfredo sauce isn’t really Italian- it’s American. I’ll give you a <strong>quick</strong> history lesson. This sauce was born in Rome from a man named Alfredo. His sauce was a simple emulsification of butter, Parmesan cheese, and pasta. The version we know and love today includes garlic and cream for a <strong>saucier</strong> consistency. So I guess we can call this modernized sauce an Italian-American lovechild.</p>

        <p><strong>Tips for Making the Perfect Alfredo Sauce</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The sauce will seem thin when you start to mix in the pasta. Don’t worry, just keep tossing. The starches from the pasta will mix into the sauce to give the the perfect consistency. If you use flour or cornstarch to thicken the sauce, it may come out with a gluey consistency once it’s cooled down a bit.</li>
            <li>You can add a few tsp of Italian seasoning, a pinch of nutmeg or red pepper flakes to add some flare to this sauce. Feel free to get creative with seasoning.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the ratio of cream to milk in this recipe to suit how rich you’d like it to be.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>3.</strong> Pour in the milk and cream. Stir consistently to avoid burning on the bottom of the pan until the mixture comes to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium, and mix in the parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Adjust the seasoning to your own taste.<br>
        <strong>4.</strong> Remove the pan from the heat and mix in the cooked pasta until the sauce begins to thicken. Garnish with parsley, and serve.</p>
